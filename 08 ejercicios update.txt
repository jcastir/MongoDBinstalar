This page uses the following mongo shell methods:

db.collection.updateOne(<filter>, <update>, <options>)
db.collection.updateMany(<filter>, <update>, <options>)
db.collection.replaceOne(<filter>, <update>, <options>)
The examples on this page use the inventory collection. To create and/or populate the inventory collection, run the following:

db.inventory.insertMany( [
   { item: "canvas", qty: 100, size: { h: 28, w: 35.5, uom: "cm" }, status: "A" },
   { item: "journal", qty: 25, size: { h: 14, w: 21, uom: "cm" }, status: "A" },
   { item: "mat", qty: 85, size: { h: 27.9, w: 35.5, uom: "cm" }, status: "A" },
   { item: "mousepad", qty: 25, size: { h: 19, w: 22.85, uom: "cm" }, status: "P" },
   { item: "notebook", qty: 50, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: "in" }, status: "P" },
   { item: "paper", qty: 100, size: { h: 8.5, w: 11, uom: "in" }, status: "D" },
   { item: "planner", qty: 75, size: { h: 22.85, w: 30, uom: "cm" }, status: "D" },
   { item: "postcard", qty: 45, size: { h: 10, w: 15.25, uom: "cm" }, status: "A" },
   { item: "sketchbook", qty: 80, size: { h: 14, w: 21, uom: "cm" }, status: "A" },
   { item: "sketch pad", qty: 95, size: { h: 22.85, w: 30.5, uom: "cm" }, status: "A" }
] );

You can run the operation in the web shell below:

UPDATE ONE 


Update Documents in a Collection
To update a document, MongoDB provides update operators, such as $set, to modify field values.

To use the update operators, pass to the update methods an update document of the form:

{
  <update operator>: { <field1>: <value1>, ... },
  <update operator>: { <field2>: <value2>, ... },
  ...
}
Some update operators, such as $set, will create the field if the field does not exist. See the individual update operator reference for details.

NOTE

Starting in MongoDB 4.2, MongoDB can accept an aggregation pipeline to specify the modifications to make instead of an update document. See the method reference page for details.

Update a Single Document
The following example uses the db.collection.updateOne() method on the inventory collection to update the first document where item equals "paper":

db.inventory.updateOne(
   { item: "paper" },
   {
     $set: { "size.uom": "cm", status: "P" },
     $currentDate: { lastModified: true }
   }
)
The update operation:

uses the $set operator to update the value of the size.uom field to "cm" and the value of the status field to "P",
uses the $currentDate operator to update the value of the lastModified field to the current date. If lastModified field does not exist, $currentDate will create the field. See $currentDate for details.
Update Multiple Documents
New in version 3.2.

The following example uses the db.collection.updateMany() method on the inventory collection to update all documents where qty is less than 50:

db.inventory.updateMany(
   { "qty": { $lt: 50 } },
   {
     $set: { "size.uom": "in", status: "P" },
     $currentDate: { lastModified: true }
   }
)
The update operation:

uses the $set operator to update the value of the size.uom field to "in" and the value of the status field to "P",
uses the $currentDate operator to update the value of the lastModified field to the current date. If lastModified field does not exist, $currentDate will create the field. See $currentDate for details.
Replace a Document
To replace the entire content of a document except for the _id field, pass an entirely new document as the second argument to db.collection.replaceOne().

When replacing a document, the replacement document must consist of only field/value pairs; i.e. do not include update operators expressions.

The replacement document can have different fields from the original document. In the replacement document, you can omit the _id field since the _id field is immutable; however, if you do include the _id field, it must have the same value as the current value.

The following example replaces the first document from the inventory collection where item: "paper":

db.inventory.replaceOne(
   { item: "paper" },
   { item: "paper", instock: [ { warehouse: "A", qty: 60 }, { warehouse: "B", qty: 40 } ] }
)
Behavior
Atomicity
All write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single document. For more information on MongoDB and atomicity, see Atomicity and Transactions.

_id Field
Once set, you cannot update the value of the _id field nor can you replace an existing document with a replacement document that has a different _id field value.

Field Order
MongoDB preserves the order of the document fields following write operations except for the following cases:

The _id field is always the first field in the document.
Updates that include renaming of field names may result in the reordering of fields in the document.
Changed in version 2.6: Starting in version 2.6, MongoDB actively attempts to preserve the field order in a document. Before version 2.6, MongoDB did not actively preserve the order of the fields in a document.

Upsert Option
If updateOne(), updateMany(), or replaceOne() includes upsert : true and no documents match the specified filter, then the operation creates a new document and inserts it. If there are matching documents, then the operation modifies or replaces the matching document or documents.

For details on the new document created, see the individual reference pages for the methods.

Write Acknowledgement
With write concerns, you can specify the level of acknowledgement requested from MongoDB for write operations. For details, see Write Concern.

UPDATE MANY 


The updateMany() method has the following form:

db.collection.updateMany(
   <filter>,
   <update>,
   {
     upsert: <boolean>,
     writeConcern: <document>,
     collation: <document>,
     arrayFilters: [ <filterdocument1>, ... ]
   }
)


For example:

db.collection.updateMany(
   <query>,
   { $set: { status: "D" }, $inc: { quantity: 2 } },
   ...
)
Update with an Aggregation Pipeline
Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the db.collection.updateMany() method can accept an aggregation pipeline [ <stage1>, <stage2>, ... ] that specifies the modifications to perform. The pipeline can consist of the following stages:

$addFields and its alias $set
$project and its alias $unset
$replaceRoot and its alias $replaceWith.
Using the aggregation pipeline allows for a more expressive update statement, such as expressing conditional updates based on current field values or updating one field using the value of another field(s).

For example:

db.collection.updateMany(
   <query>,
   [
      { $set: { status: "Modified", comments: [ "$misc1", "$misc2" ] } },
      { $unset: [ "misc1", "misc2" ] }
   ]
   ...
)


Examples
Update Multiple Documents
The restaurant collection contains the following documents:

{ "_id" : 1, "name" : "Central Perk Cafe", "violations" : 3 }
{ "_id" : 2, "name" : "Rock A Feller Bar and Grill", "violations" : 2 }
{ "_id" : 3, "name" : "Empire State Sub", "violations" : 5 }
{ "_id" : 4, "name" : "Pizza Rat's Pizzaria", "violations" : 8 }
The following operation updates all documents where violations are greater than 4 and $set a flag for review:

try {
   db.restaurant.updateMany(
      { violations: { $gt: 4 } },
      { $set: { "Review" : true } }
   );
} catch (e) {
   print(e);
}
The operation returns:

{ "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 2, "modifiedCount" : 2 }
The collection now contains the following documents:

{ "_id" : 1, "name" : "Central Perk Cafe", "violations" : 3 }
{ "_id" : 2, "name" : "Rock A Feller Bar and Grill", "violations" : 2 }
{ "_id" : 3, "name" : "Empire State Sub", "violations" : 5, "Review" : true }
{ "_id" : 4, "name" : "Pizza Rat's Pizzaria", "violations" : 8, "Review" : true }
If no matches were found, the operation instead returns:

{ "acknowledged" : true, "matchedCount" : 0, "modifiedCount" : 0 }
Setting upsert: true would insert a document if no match was found.

Update with Aggregation Pipeline
Starting in MongoDB 4.2, the db.collection.updateMany() can use an aggregation pipeline for the update. The pipeline can consist of the following stages:

$addFields and its alias $set
$project and its alias $unset
$replaceRoot and its alias $replaceWith.
Using the aggregation pipeline allows for a more expressive update statement, such as expressing conditional updates based on current field values or updating one field using the value of another field(s).

Example 1
The following examples uses the aggregation pipeline to modify a field using the values of the other fields in the document.

Create a members collection with the following documents:

db.members.insertMany([
   { "_id" : 1, "member" : "abc123", "status" : "A", "points" : 2, "misc1" : "note to self: confirm status", "misc2" : "Need to activate" },
   { "_id" : 2, "member" : "xyz123", "status" : "A", "points" : 60, "misc1" : "reminder: ping me at 100pts", "misc2" : "Some random comment" }
])
Assume that instead of separate misc1 and misc2 fields, you want to gather these into a new comments field. The following update operation uses an aggregation pipeline to add the new comments field and remove the misc1 and misc2 fields for all documents in the collection.

db.members.updateMany(
   { },
   [
      { $set: { status: "Modified", comments: [ "$misc1", "$misc2" ] } },
      { $unset: [ "misc1", "misc2" ] }
   ]
)
NOTE

The $set and $unset used in the pipeline refers to the aggregation stages $set and $unset respectively, and not the update operators $set and $unset.

First Stage
The $set stage creates a new array field comments whose elements are the current content of the misc1 and misc2 fields.
Second Stage
The $unset stage removes the misc1 and misc2 fields.
After the command, the collection contains the following documents:

{ "_id" : 1, "member" : "abc123", "status" : "Modified", "points" : 2, "comments" : [ "note to self: confirm status", "Need to activate" ] }
{ "_id" : 2, "member" : "xyz123", "status" : "Modified", "points" : 60, "comments" : [ "reminder: ping me at 100pts", "Some random comment" ] }
Example 2
The aggregation pipeline allows the update to perform conditional updates based on the current field values as well as use current field values to calculate a separate field value.

For example, create a students3 collection with the following documents:

db.students3.insert([
   { "_id" : 1, "tests" : [ 95, 92, 90 ] },
   { "_id" : 2, "tests" : [ 94, 88, 90 ] },
   { "_id" : 3, "tests" : [ 70, 75, 82 ] }
]);
Using an aggregation pipeline, you can update the documents with the calculated grade average and letter grade.

db.students3.updateMany(
   { },
   [
     { $set: { average : { $avg: "$tests" } } },
     { $set: { grade: { $switch: {
                           branches: [
                               { case: { $gte: [ "$average", 90 ] }, then: "A" },
                               { case: { $gte: [ "$average", 80 ] }, then: "B" },
                               { case: { $gte: [ "$average", 70 ] }, then: "C" },
                               { case: { $gte: [ "$average", 60 ] }, then: "D" }
                           ],
                           default: "F"
     } } } }
   ]
)
NOTE

The $set used in the pipeline refers to the aggregation stage $set, and not the update operators $set.

First Stage
The $set stage calculates a new field average based on the average of the tests field. See $avg for more information on the $avg aggregation operator.
Second Stage
The $set stage calculates a new field grade based on the average field calculated in the previous stage. See $switch for more information on the $switch aggregation operator.
After the command, the collection contains the following documents:

{ "_id" : 1, "tests" : [ 95, 92, 90 ], "average" : 92.33333333333333, "grade" : "A" }
{ "_id" : 2, "tests" : [ 94, 88, 90 ], "average" : 90.66666666666667, "grade" : "A" }
{ "_id" : 3, "tests" : [ 70, 75, 82 ], "average" : 75.66666666666667, "grade" : "C" }
Update Multiple Documents with Upsert
The inspectors collection contains the following documents:

{ "_id" : 92412, "inspector" : "F. Drebin", "Sector" : 1, "Patrolling" : true },
{ "_id" : 92413, "inspector" : "J. Clouseau", "Sector" : 2, "Patrolling" : false },
{ "_id" : 92414, "inspector" : "J. Clouseau", "Sector" : 3, "Patrolling" : true },
{ "_id" : 92415, "inspector" : "R. Coltrane", "Sector" : 3, "Patrolling" : false }
The following operation updates all documents with Sector greater than 4 and inspector equal to "R. Coltrane":

try {
   db.inspectors.updateMany(
      { "Sector" : { $gt : 4 }, "inspector" : "R. Coltrane" },
      { $set: { "Patrolling" : false } },
      { upsert: true }
   );
} catch (e) {
   print(e);
}
The operation returns:

{
   "acknowledged" : true,
   "matchedCount" : 0,
   "modifiedCount" : 0,
   "upsertedId" : ObjectId("56fc5dcb39ee682bdc609b02")
}
The collection now contains the following documents:

{ "_id" : 92412, "inspector" : "F. Drebin", "Sector" : 1, "Patrolling" : true },
{ "_id" : 92413, "inspector" : "J. Clouseau", "Sector" : 2, "Patrolling" : false },
{ "_id" : 92414, "inspector" : "J. Clouseau", "Sector" : 3, "Patrolling" : true },
{ "_id" : 92415, "inspector" : "R. Coltrane", "Sector" : 3, "Patrolling" : false },
{ "_id" : ObjectId("56fc5dcb39ee682bdc609b02"), "inspector" : "R. Coltrane", "Patrolling" : false }
Since no documents matched the filter, and upsert was true, updateMany inserted the document with a generated _id, the equality conditions from the filter, and the update modifiers.

Update with Write Concern
Given a three member replica set, the following operation specifies a w of majority and wtimeout of 100:

try {
   db.restaurant.updateMany(
       { "name" : "Pizza Rat's Pizzaria" },
       { $inc: { "violations" : 3}, $set: { "Closed" : true } },
       { w: "majority", wtimeout: 100 }
   );
} catch (e) {
   print(e);
}
If the acknowledgement takes longer than the wtimeout limit, the following exception is thrown:

WriteConcernError({
   "code" : 64,
   "errInfo" : {
      "wtimeout" : true
   },
   "errmsg" : "waiting for replication timed out"
}) :
undefined
The wtimeout error only indicates that the operation did not complete on time. The write operation itself can still succeed outside of the set time limit.

Specify Collation
New in version 3.4.

Collation allows users to specify language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for lettercase and accent marks.

A collection myColl has the following documents:

{ _id: 1, category: "café", status: "A" }
{ _id: 2, category: "cafe", status: "a" }
{ _id: 3, category: "cafE", status: "a" }
The following operation includes the collation option:

db.myColl.updateMany(
   { category: "cafe" },
   { $set: { status: "Updated" } },
   { collation: { locale: "fr", strength: 1 } }
);
Specify arrayFilters for an Array Update Operations
New in version 3.6.

Starting in MongoDB 3.6, when updating an array field, you can specify arrayFilters that determine which array elements to update.

Update Elements Match arrayFilters Criteria
Create a collection students with the following documents:

db.students.insert([
   { "_id" : 1, "grades" : [ 95, 92, 90 ] },
   { "_id" : 2, "grades" : [ 98, 100, 102 ] },
   { "_id" : 3, "grades" : [ 95, 110, 100 ] }
])
To update all elements that are greater than or equal to 100 in the grades array, use the filtered positional operator $[<identifier>] with the arrayFilters option:

db.students.updateMany(
   { grades: { $gte: 100 } },
   { $set: { "grades.$[element]" : 100 } },
   { arrayFilters: [ { "element": { $gte: 100 } } ] }
)
After the operation, the collection contains the following documents:

{ "_id" : 1, "grades" : [ 95, 92, 90 ] }
{ "_id" : 2, "grades" : [ 98, 100, 100 ] }
{ "_id" : 3, "grades" : [ 95, 100, 100 ] }
Update Specific Elements of an Array of Documents
Create a collection students2 with the following documents:

db.students2.insert([
   {
      "_id" : 1,
      "grades" : [
         { "grade" : 80, "mean" : 75, "std" : 6 },
         { "grade" : 85, "mean" : 90, "std" : 4 },
         { "grade" : 85, "mean" : 85, "std" : 6 }
      ]
   },
   {
      "_id" : 2,
      "grades" : [
         { "grade" : 90, "mean" : 75, "std" : 6 },
         { "grade" : 87, "mean" : 90, "std" : 3 },
         { "grade" : 85, "mean" : 85, "std" : 4 }
      ]
   }
])
To modify the value of the mean field for all elements in the grades array where the grade is greater than or equal to 85, use the filtered positional operator $[<identifier>] with the arrayFilters:

db.students2.updateMany(
   { },
   { $set: { "grades.$[elem].mean" : 100 } },
   { arrayFilters: [ { "elem.grade": { $gte: 85 } } ] }
)
After the operation, the collection has the following documents:

{
   "_id" : 1,
   "grades" : [
      { "grade" : 80, "mean" : 75, "std" : 6 },
      { "grade" : 85, "mean" : 100, "std" : 4 },
      { "grade" : 85, "mean" : 100, "std" : 6 }
   ]
}
{
   "_id" : 2,
   "grades" : [
      { "grade" : 90, "mean" : 100, "std" : 6 },
      { "grade" : 87, "mean" : 100, "std" : 3 },
      { "grade" : 85, "mean" : 100, "std" : 4 }
   ]
}
